                    <p>Step Into The Sun started out as a simple mantra for Taylor Dalton, the creator and coder behind the Step Into The Sun blog. Taylor struggles with bi-polar disorder and severe depression, and though she feels like she's in a good place now, it hasn't always felt that way.
                    <br><br>During a time that felt so dark, Taylor didn't know if she would ever see the light again, she clung to the words "step into the sun" after hearing them in a song. Every since those words helped pull her back from such a dark place, Taylor has used the phrase as a way to motivate her to keep going. She started this blog to connect with other people with mental illness and to show them that they're never alone.
                    <br><br>Step Into The Sun believes that mental health is health and that it should be taken just as seriously as any other medical illness. You never know what someone is going through, so it's important to move through the world with kindness and empathy.
                    <br><br>Step Into The Sun is a blog that aims to help others understand more about mental health, encourage anyone struggling to seek help, to shed light on the seriousness of mental illness, and to share the stories and experiences of mental health, driving that no one is truly alone in this life.
                    <br><br>Your mental health matters. Your life matters. You matter.</p>
